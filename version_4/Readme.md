Here I used 2 models, one which was working perfectly for left hand and one which was working for right hands. In pyhton script, if the left hand got detected than it will use the model which was perfectly responding on left hand sign to recognize the sign and if the right hand got detected than it will use the model which was was perfectly responding on right hand sign to recognize the sign. But it was still unable to recognize the sign accuratly.
